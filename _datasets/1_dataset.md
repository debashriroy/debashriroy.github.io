Massive multiple input and multiple output (mMIMO) is a critical component in upcoming 5G wireless deployment as an enabler for high data rate communications. mMIMO is effective when each corresponding antenna pair of the respective transmitter-receiver arrays experiences an independent channel. We publish a simulation dataset containing CSI information of mmWave band with a 32-element array base station, and a user equipment with a 4-element array, collected in MATLAB.
