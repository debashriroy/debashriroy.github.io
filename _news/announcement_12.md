On February 23rd, 2024, TWiST lab members, Sunday Amatare and Michelle Samson, had the honor of representing the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Annual Banquet of the College of Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). A big Congratulations to both Sunday and Michelle! :sparkles: :sparkles:

This distinguished opportunity was earned through an internal nomination and a competitive selection process among the outstanding works of fellow students. The event, graced by the presence of Jennifer Cowley, PhD (President of UTA), Regent Kelly Warren (Executive Chairman of Energy Transfer LP), esteemed faculty members, and dignitaries from both academic and industry sectors, served as a platform to showcase our departmentâ€™s excellence.

The event presented another opportunity to highlight the achievements of the Transformative Wireless Systems and Technology (TWIST) Lab as well as to establish valuable connections.

Thanks to the organizers of the event and the Department of Computer Science & Engineering for granting us the opportunity to enhance the visibility of our work on this platform.
