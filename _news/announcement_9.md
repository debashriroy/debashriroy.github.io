On January 23rd, the TWiST Lab at the University of Texas at Arlington hosted a lab tour for four Master's students from Northeastern University, China, accompanied by their counselor. This event provided an opportunity for the visitors to gain insights into the ongoing research and projects spearheaded by the lab's researchers. Overseen by Dr. Debashri Roy, the tour was structured around three key presentations by lab members.

First, at 10:05 AM, Michelle Samson presented on the Robot Navigation Project. Following this, at 10:25 AM, Mohammad Hasibur Rahman presented on the Spectrum Learning  project. He also showed a demo to explain how this project helped in identifying signals that could potentially interfere with primary tier signals, such as naval radio communications. The final presentation was by Fuhad Foesal Ahmed at 10:40 AM, who demonstrated the flow graph of GNU Radio Project, focusing on the analysis of signal frequencies.

The tour concluded at 11:00 AM, leaving room for a Q&A session and an exchange of compliments with the visiting students, thereby enriching their understanding of the lab's research endeavors.
