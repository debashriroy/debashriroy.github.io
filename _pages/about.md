I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Texas Arlington since Fall 2023. Prior to this, I was an Associate Research Scientist at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University for three years. During that time, I was associated with Next Generation Networks and Systems (GENESYS) lab, directed by <a href= "https://genesys-lab.org" parent = '_blank'> Prof. Kaushik Roy Chowdhury </a>. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science under the supervision of Dr. Mainak Chatterjee in Spring 2020 from Department of Computer Science, University of Central Florida. I also received Master of Science (Spring 2018) in Computer Science from the same university <a href= "https://debashriroy.github.io/assets/pdf/Debashri_Roy_Latest_CV_2023.pdf" parent='_blank'>[Details in my CV] </a>.
