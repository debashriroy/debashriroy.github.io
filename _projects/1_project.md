In this project we solve the problem of fast beam selection in mmWave band by using non-RF sensor data such as LiDAR, camera images and GPS coordinates. We have <a href="https://debashriroy.github.io/conferences/"> <font color="#3333FF">2 papers in conference proceedings</font></a>,
  <a href="https://debashriroy.github.io/journals/"><font color="#3333FF">2 in IEEE magazine and transactions</font></a>, and multiple under submission as a result of this project.
