In this project we solve the problem of automative beamforming in mmWave band using an interactive communication between real and virtual world which provides a multiverse of digital twins. We have <a href="https://debashriroy.github.io/journals/"><font color="#3333FF">one article</font> published in <font color="#3333FF">IEEE Networks Magazine</font></a>  and one under submission in <font color="#3333FF">IEEE Transactions on Networking</font>, and several under preparation.
